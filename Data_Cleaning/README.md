<h2> Data Cleaning : Python </h2>

- Data cleaning is an essential step in the data analysis and machine learning process. It involves preparing and preprocessing data for use in a model by converting data format, removing duplicate data, dealing with missing data, detecting outliers, feature engineering, and feature selection.

<h2> Exercices </h2>

- In this section, I'll be exploring some data cleaning techniques, summarized in the following exercices:

  - [Data-Cleaning](./Data_Cleaning.ipynb): Create dataframe, create a new column in a df, or delete it. Populate a newly added column, replace a value in a df.
    > You can access it directly in google colab at this link: [Google-Colab-Data-Cleaning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yppmGDxaOKZZq1eRsWxk-BFM9aEpk2fM?usp=sharing)

- Here, we will be discussing the Levenshtein-Distance ALgorithm, below you'll find a simple explanation of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm:

**The Levenshtein Distance** algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into another. It works like this:

    - **Take two words/strings as input**
    - **Compare the characters of both strings one by one**
    - **If the characters are the same, go to the next pair**
    - **If the characters are different, it's an edit**
    - **An edit can be an insertion, deletion or substitution of a character**
    - **Count each difference as 1 edit**
    - **Keep track of the minimum number of edits needed**
    - **Go through all possible edit scenarios**
    - **The lowest count of edits is the Levenshtein Distance**

    > Example:
    ```
    Strings: kitten, sitting

    Compare k vs s -> difference, 1 edit
    Compare i vs i -> same, no edit
    Compare t vs t -> same, no edit
    Compare t vs i -> difference, 1 more edit
    Compare e vs t -> difference, 1 more edit
    Compare n vs n -> same, no edit
    Compare vs g -> difference, 1 more edit

    Minimum edits needed is 3 (substitution, insertion, substitution)
    So Levenshtein Distance between the words is 3
    ```

    > In simple terms, it finds the minimum number of single-character changes required to transform one word into another. This gives a measure of difference between strings.
