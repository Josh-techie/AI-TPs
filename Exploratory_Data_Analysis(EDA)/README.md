> EDA : Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

---

<h2> Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h2>

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial initial step in any data analysis project. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables. This repository will cover the fundamentals of EDA, including practical exercises to help you apply these concepts effectively.

<h2> Why Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)? </h2>

- Helps in understanding the structure and nature of the data.
- Identifies patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
- Guides feature selection and engineering.
- Assists in preparing data for modeling.
- Provides insights for further analysis and decision-making.

<h2> Steps to Follow for Analysis </h2>

1. **Loading Data**: Import the dataset into Python using libraries like Pandas.
2. **Understanding the Data**: Explore the dataset's dimensions, data types, and initial observations.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and address missing values in the dataset.
4. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics to describe the data.
5. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to gain insights into the data distribution.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Transform and create new features based on existing data.
7. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze relationships between variables using correlation metrics.
8. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.
9. **Conclusion**: Summarize key findings and insights from the EDA process.

<h2> Content Table </h2>

- **Exercice 1**: Use Seaborn along with Matplotlib libraries to visualize the data in a bar plot format, demonstrating the correlation of profit with the year for a specific organization. Introduce a new variable using hue to visualize alongside the existing ones.

- **Exercice 2**: Use a bar chart to display the correlation between the continent and life expectancy. Deduce your insights using a bar plot from the Seaborn library.

- **Exercice 3**: Utilize the melt method in the Pandas library to reshape a DataFrame and visualize its data. Conduct a case study on the data of assists and goals between the two legends, Messi and Ronaldo. Visualize the data and make judgments based on the numbers.

Each exercise will provide hands-on practice with EDA techniques, reinforcing your understanding of the concepts discussed in this repository.
