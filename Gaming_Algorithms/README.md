# Gaming_Algorithms:

This directory contains an implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the Min-Max algorithm. The game is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, and the Min-Max algorithm is used to power the artificial intelligence (AI) player.

---

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game:

- The Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented here allows users to play against an AI opponent that utilizes the Min-Max algorithm to make intelligent moves. The game provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter.

---

### File Structure:

- **min_max.py:** Contains the Min-Max algorithm implementation, including the `minmax`, `evaluate`, `game_over`, and `get_children` functions.
- **tictactoe_gui.py:** Implements the GUI for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Users can play against the AI, which makes use of the Min-Max algorithm to make strategic moves.

---

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Execute the `Tic_Tac_Toe.py` file using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python Tic_Tac_Toe.py
   ```

3. The game window will appear, allowing you to play against the AI.

---

### Customization

- Feel free to customize the Min-Max algorithm, game rules, and GUI elements to suit your preferences. You can adjust the depth of the Min-Max search, enhance the evaluation function, or modify the appearance of the GUI.

---

## Acknowledgments

- This implementation is based on the Min-Max algorithm, a classic approach in artificial intelligence for game-playing. Implemented during my course AI in my university curriculum.
