<h1> Python Basics </h1>

- In this repository, I have meticulously documented my personal journey into artificial intelligence during my college years. Designed to assist beginners, the repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning the basics of Python programming. It offers simple examples and explanations, providing an accessible introduction to fundamental concepts.

<h1> Editor used </h1>

> ### [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/): Colaboratory, or Colab for short, is a Google Research product, which allows developers to write and execute Python code through their browser.

- I'll be using Google Colab for these exercises. You may be wondering the `Why Google Colab?`. Well It's a powerful platform that combines Python, rich text, and the ability to add and run code snippets. It's also great for sharing, as you can include live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

> There are several reasons to opt to use Google Colab instead of a plain files:

- Pre-Installed Libraries
- Saved on the Cloud
- Collaboration
- Free GPU and TPU Use

> As I'm venturing into the field of machine learning, it's crucial to familiarize myself with tools like Google Colab. It's an excellent platform for collaboration and model training, making it an indispensable tool for any machine learning practitioner.
