<h2> API </h2>

- API stands for **Application Programming Interfaces**, are tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In Python, I find APIs incredibly useful as they enable me to access and interact with external services or data. By making requests to an API, I can retrieve information, send data, or perform specific actions. This flexibility and connectivity make APIs a powerful resource for developers like me to enhance the functionality of their applications.

<h2> Exercices </h2>

- The Number of People in Space API provides real-time information about the number of people currently in space. This API does not require authentication, making it easy to access and retrieve data quickly. You can use this API to get the latest updates on astronauts aboard the International Space Station and other space missions. [Number of People in Space](https://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/) refer to it and read more to use it. In the **Exercice1**, I'll be using it and displaying the response in my script using **Requests** library.

> Don't forget `pip install requests`
