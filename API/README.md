<h2> API </h2>

- API stands for **Application Programming Interfaces**, are tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In Python, I find APIs incredibly useful as they enable me to access and interact with external services or data. By making requests to an API, I can retrieve information, send data, or perform specific actions. This flexibility and connectivity make APIs a powerful resource for developers like me to enhance the functionality of their applications.
