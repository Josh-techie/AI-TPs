<h2> Introduction Neural Networks (ANNs)</h2>

- Welcome to the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) directory! 😊 This directory serves as a beginner's guide to understanding ANNs, a fundamental concept in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. ANNs are computational models inspired by the biological neural networks of animal brains. They are used for solving a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, pattern recognition, and more.
