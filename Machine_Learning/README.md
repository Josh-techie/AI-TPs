## Machine Learning Exercises

- This repository contains three machine learning exercises, each in its respective folder, along with the necessary datasets and instructions. The exercises cover regression, classification with Random Forest, and image classification.

## Steps To follow:

> These are the steps to follow when building and evaluating a machine learning regression model.

1. Connect to the drive to retrieve the data.
2. Visualize the data.
3. Describe the data (count, mean, std, min, max, ...).
4. Select the target variable.
5. Select features without the target.
6. Split the dataset into training and testing data.
7. Choose a regression model.
8. Train the model.
9. Evaluate metrics.
10. Perform testing.
11. Visualize some test results.

## Editor:

> I would recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Azure Notebooks, or any cloud-based platform for these types of projects. This way, you won't waste time setting up the environment or downloading heavy dependencies, especially in the context of machine learning.

Note: Ofc, besides there's other advantages such as `Integration with Google Drive`, `Collaborative Editing`, `No Setup Required` and
`Free Access to GPUs`
