## Exercice 2:

1. **Connect to the Drive to Retrieve the Data:**

   - Establish a connection to the data source, in this case, the heart disease dataset hosted on Google Drive.

2. **Visualize the Data:**

   - Explore the heart disease dataset visually to understand its structure, feature distributions, and potential patterns.

3. **Describe the Data (Count, Mean, Std, Min, Max, etc.):**

   - Conduct statistical analysis to describe essential features of the dataset, providing insights into its central tendencies and variability.

4. **Select the Target Variable:**

   - Identify the target variable, which, in this case, is binary: 0 for normal and 1 for abnormal. The goal is to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in new patients.

5. **Select Features Without the Target:**

   - Choose relevant features (independent variables) from the heart disease dataset that will be used to predict the target variable. These features include information such as age, sex, and various medical measurements.

6. **Split the Dataset into Training and Testing Data:**

   - Divide the heart disease dataset into two subsets: one for training the classification model and another for testing its performance on new patient data.

7. **Choose a Classification Model (Random Forest):**

   - Opt for a Random Forest classification algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

8. **Train the Model:**

   - Use the training dataset to train the Random Forest model, allowing it to learn the patterns and relationships between the selected features and the presence of heart disease.

9. **Evaluate Metrics:**

   - Assess the performance of the trained classification model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify patients with and without heart disease.

10. **Perform Testing:**

    - Apply the trained Random Forest model to the testing dataset to evaluate its performance on unseen patient data. This step helps determine how well the model generalizes to new observations.

11. **Visualize Some Test Results:**
    - Create visualizations to interpret and communicate the results of the classification model's predictions. Visualization aids in understanding the model's strengths and potential areas for improvement in identifying heart disease.

> In summary, these steps outline the process of building and assessing a Random Forest classification model for predicting the presence of heart disease in new patients using the provided heart disease dataset.
