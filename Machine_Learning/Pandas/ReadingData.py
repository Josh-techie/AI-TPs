# by now it should be automatic to import the libraries you'll need

import pandas as pd

# read the data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")  # yeah as simple as that ðŸ˜€

# but wait how do I know if the data was read correctly?
# let's print the first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())

# if you run the code you can see it's all good.

    # hold up you have to suffer bro, before you learn! ðŸ˜‚
    # if you take a look at the data you'll see that the csv file is well structured and formatted
    # but what if the file is not well formatted, for examples instead of using `,` we used `;`

# Well I got you covered, you can use the `sep` parameter to specify the delimiter
